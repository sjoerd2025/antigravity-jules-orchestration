## [2.6.1] - 2024-12-19

### Added
- **Semantic Memory Integration**: 8 new MCP tools for persistent AI memory
  - `memory_recall_context` - Recall relevant memories for a task
  - `memory_store` - Store a memory manually
  - `memory_search` - Search memories by query

- New `lib/memory-client.js` with security-hardened memory API client

### Security
- SSRF protection with domain whitelist (memory.scarmonit.com, semantic-memory-mcp.onrender.com, localhost)
- IP address blocking to prevent whitelist bypass
- HTTPS enforcement (except localhost for development)
- Error message sanitization to prevent information disclosure
- Input validation with safe defaults for all memory operations

- Secure credential storage with AES-256-GCM encryption
- Build log analysis with intelligent error pattern recognition
- Webhook receiver at `/webhooks/render` for deployment events
- New `lib/encryption.js`, `lib/render-client.js`, `lib/render-autofix.js`, `lib/suggested-tasks.js`
- `SECURITY.md` documentation

## [2.5.1] - 2024-12-17

### Added

- Session Templates for reusable configurations
- Priority Queue with priority-based processing
- Session Cloning and Search capabilities
- PR Integration: Merge PRs, add comments directly
- Batch Retry for failed sessions
- Analytics Dashboard with success rates and trends
- New slash commands: `/templates`, `/queue`, `/analytics`

## [2.3.0] - 2024-12-17

### Added
- Ollama/RAG integration with local LLM support (23 MCP tools total)
- Claude CLI command generator and pattern learning system
- Rate limiter metrics dashboard component with unit tests
- Redis-based rate limiting with fallback to in-memory
- Multi-tier rate limiting for API protection
- Comprehensive test suite (287 tests: 270 backend + 17 dashboard)

### Changed
- Migrated production URL to scarmonit.com
- Updated test configuration for proper backend (node:test) and dashboard (vitest) runners
- Made GitHub Actions JULES_API_KEY check non-blocking (runtime validation is authoritative)
- Enhanced WebSocket heartbeat mechanism for connection health monitoring

### Fixed
- CRITICAL: Webhook signature bypass vulnerability
- CRITICAL: Path traversal vulnerability in file operations
- HIGH: Fixed duplicate HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL declaration causing ES module errors
- HIGH: Addressed security vulnerabilities from PR #9 review
- Fixed React production build test compatibility issues

### Security
- Implemented webhook signature verification with timing-safe comparison
- Added path traversal prevention with strict path validation
- Enhanced CORS configuration for production domains
- Improved rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Performance
- Phase 1: Security hardening and memory optimization
- Phase 2: HIGH priority optimizations for concurrent operations
- Optimized WebSocket connection management with automatic dead connection cleanup

## [1.5.0] - Previous Release

### Features
- Initial MCP server with Jules API integration
- GitHub webhook receiver
- PostgreSQL workflow state management
- React Mission Control dashboard
